\section{Introduction}
Yelp is an internet company offering people to review businesses by assigning them a star rating 1 through 5. It was founded by Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons in 2004 and has grown to one of the biggest rating website and app in the world \cite{yelp}. There are 5 million reviews of restaurants in their database and it includes the US, Europe and Asia. 
Due to Yelp's potential to make a business rise or fall, many are interested in maximizing their own rating. 
Fortunately Yelp provides big data sets containing user and business information alongside reviews. Utilizing this data
it might be possible to supply some factors to which business owners should pay attention to in order to attain a good rating.


For this project we picked out 500 000 of these reviews and used classification machine learning algorithms to see if they 
can predict which rating the customers are most likely to give. Our hypothesis is to see if a classification analysis on
meta data from reviews extracted from Yelp can be used to predict reviews for a business in question with machine learning
algorithms. This project has the aim to see if machine learning can be used in a practical way and hopefully then offer a good statistical analysis for business owners to use in the future.
