\begin{abstract}
Classification is performed on Yelp reviews in an attempt to predict a rating based on previous business and user data.
The methods employed are logistic regression, random forest and AdaBoost. All methods gave similar performance with logistic
regression consistently performing slightly better. When ranking features by importance it is discovered that the 
average business rating and average user rating are by far the most important features, entailing that the models are of minimal
assistance if one wishes to predict ratings for the purpose of helping businesses bettering their ratings.
