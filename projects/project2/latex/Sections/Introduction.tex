\section{Introduction}

Neural networks have had a renaissance in the recent decades. Their predictive
power has fueled progress in a wide variety of fields, from physics to online
marketing.

Here we will study neural nets by regression on coupling constants of  a 1D Ising
model and classifying phases from a 2D Ising model. The results are compared to
more standard machine learning techniques, least squares regression, Ridge
regression and lasso regression, and logistic regression, respectively.

Comparisons are made to the works of Mehta et al.\cite{mehta}, and much of the data
and analyses are inspired by their paper. Besides comparing the results with
them, my implementations are checked against \texttt{sklearn} and the Julia
package \texttt{Flux.jl}
