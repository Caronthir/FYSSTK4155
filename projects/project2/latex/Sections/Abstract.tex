\begin{abstract}
  Feed forward multilayered perceptron neural networks are studied by writing
  an implementation in the Julia language and compared to least squares, Ridge
  and lasso regression for linear regression, and logistic regression for
  classification. The data modeled is Ising model in 1D and 2D, and the physical
  results and choice of hyperparameters are compared to the works of Mehta et
  al. Our results consistently agree with theirs, with neural nets outperforming
  standard machine learning methods for classification, but being worse than
  Ridge and Lasso for regression. As the problems are relatively easy, the
  optimal results are found using \(5\) to \(10\) neurons with ReLU or leaky ReLU and a
  learning rate \(\eta < 0.1\) for classification.
