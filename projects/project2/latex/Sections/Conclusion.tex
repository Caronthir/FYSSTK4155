\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}

Neural network is a very versatile method capable of repeating and outperforming
the results of more traditional machine learning methods in linear and logistic
regression. Ridge and Lasso regressions were found to outperform neural nets on
regression, but this is not comparable as the neural nets used were the simplest
possible, with no regularization. For classification problems the neural net
greatly outperformed logistic regression by gradient descent. The results
obtained are all in agreement with Mehta et al. The full extent of neural nets
were not adequately explored due to design flaws and lack of time, but remains
an area for future investigation.
