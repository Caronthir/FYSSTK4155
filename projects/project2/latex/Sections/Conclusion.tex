\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
Three methods of regression were examined and applied to model terrain features.
Ordinary least squares managed to fit local features at the expense of
overfitting, boundary issues and ill-conditioned matrices. Introducing
regularization fixed these problems. Lasso had the additional advantage of
setting many coefficients to exactly zero, discarding them from the models.
Nevertheless, these methods proved to perform poorly at modeling terrains, and
it is recommended that other methods are used instead.
