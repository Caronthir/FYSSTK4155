\begin{abstract}
  The behavior of ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge and Lasso regularization
  are studied by applying them to both synthetic terrain using the Franke
  function and real world terrain data. The design matrix is constructed using
  polynomials in two dimensions up to degree \(5\) as well as all interactions.
  OLS suffer from numerical instability due to high colinearity of the
  polynomial terms, remedied by regularization. None of the methods is suited
  for modeling terrain features in practice due to high variance of the data and
  colinearity of the design matrix.
