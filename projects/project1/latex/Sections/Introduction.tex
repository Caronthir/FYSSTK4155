\section{Introduction}

Regression is the bread and butter of the data science field. Having a deep
understanding of the basic methods of regression is essential to build models
that not only predict, but explain the observed phenomena under study. Arguably
the three most basic methods are ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge
regularization and Lasso regularization. These will be explored using first the
Franke function, a function capturing some features of hills and valleys, before
continuing onto real world terrain data.
