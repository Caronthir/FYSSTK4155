# FYSSTK4155
Currently shows status for project 1.
All tests can be run by running `pytest`. Mutation testing is more complicated, requiring `cosmic-ray`. 
It is a very time consuming process, and is recommended to only run if necessary. The results from a previous
run is available in the `first.sqlite` file.
